# scraper-examples

These are two small examples I reference during my presentation at Drupal GovCon 2023. They demonstrate
how to scrape content, using https://www.drupalgovcon.com as an example.

govcon-scaper-example contains a small shell script to download a website into static html files, and a
small php script which can generate a csv of website content that can be imported.

content_crawler is a small Drupal 10 module that shows how to import content from a web crawler manually
and populating drupal fields on the fly.
